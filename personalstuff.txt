I want to create a place for people to share articles that have helped them master git (does that at least count as a half-pun?). This article is a work in progress. 
As such, you might want to come back in the present, 
or even suggest edits of your own in the responses section. This list was created to serve as a “Bookmarking” page for me, and I hope it can do the same for you, too. Happy exploring!
